# Pikelet

A simple language.

This is planned to meet the demands of the 'next version of Pikelet', as
described in [_Pondering the next version of Pikelet_][next-pikelet].

## Roadmap

Our main aim is to start off with a simple configuration language, like
[Dhall][dhall]. From there we will progressively add features to gain more
flexibility. We want to provide a textual syntax up-front, but we should aim to
keep the core language reasonably decoupled from this, allowing us to provide
support for [projectional editing][structure-editor-wikipedia] in the future.
