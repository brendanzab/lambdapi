Pikelet is a small, functional, dependently typed programming language.

Dependent types allow us to do a bunch of really interesting things, like using
records for modules, declaring the length of arrays at the type level, and
much more â€” many of great utility for low-level and high-level code alike!

We hope to one day grow Pikelet into fully-fledged systems programming language,
with support for unboxed data types, control over memory layout and allocation
strategy, linear types, and a flexible phase distinction and support for calling
other languages. At the moment however we've only implemented a type checker and
very slow  interpreter, so don't get your hopes up too much yet! There's still a
whole lot to do before it is even remotely useful to anyone! ðŸ˜…

## Roadmap

Our main aim is to start off with a simple configuration language, like
[Dhall][dhall]. From there we will progressively add features to gain more
flexibility. We want to provide a textual syntax up-front, but we should aim to
keep the core language reasonably decoupled from this, allowing us to provide
support for [projectional editing][structure-editor-wikipedia] in the future.
