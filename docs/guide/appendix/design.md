## Design goals

Pikelet should feel:

- Friendly
- Liberating
- Sympathetic

This is a rough list of things that might be interesting to explore with Pikelet:

- Sympathetic to humans
    - Programs should look pretty, and read clearly
    - Friendly community
    - Helpful interactive tooling
    - Tight feedback loops
- Sympathetic to machines
    - Predictable performance
    - Predictable memory layout
    - Predictable optimizations
    - Zero (or close to zero) cost abstractions
    - Low level control
    - Minimal runtime
- Sympathetic to real-world realities
    - Gradual correctness (eg. examples -> generative tests -> solvers -> proofs)
    - Provide clearly marked escape hatches (learn from the lessons of [RustBelt](rust-belt)?)
    - Automatic upgrades of code - between language and library versions
    - Work for large scale systems
- Sympathetic to mathematical foundations
    - Simple core language that can be formalized and proven sound
    - Should allow for mathematically inspired patterns of code reuse
    - Allow newcomers to learn mathematical thinking gradually
    - Adaptable to future developments in type theory

It's unclear how many of these will be able to be met, and what priorities these
should have, so this list might change over time. Come and [chat with us][gitter-channel]
if you'd like to give your input and get involved!

## Some key features of interest

- [Dependent types](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dependent_type)
- [Purely functional](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pure_function)
- [Strict evaluation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eager_evaluation)
- Implicit arguments
- Dependent records+instance arguments as first class modules/type classes
- Non-uniform memory layout - custom data layouts for records and variants?
- [Quantitative type theory](https://bentnib.org/quantitative-type-theory.pdf)
  for [erasure](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Type_erasure) and
  [linear types](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Substructural_type_system#Linear_type_systems)
- Totality checking
- Explicit tail-call elimination
- Excellent editor support with fast, incremental program analysis
- Interactive program development using holes
- Refinement types for lightweight verification

Some more hand-wavey ideas:

- Monomorphization by partial-evaluation of instance arguments
- Optional/configurable garbage collection
- Alternatives to currying for function application?
- First-class declarations (Levitation or Elaborator Reflection could be useful here)

Some other features that may be trickier to integrate given the previous
features and design goals:

- [Effect systems/Algebraic Effects](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Effect_system)
    - could make it easier to integrate async-io without needing to build it in
    - how do we use effects for generative modules?
    - how do we makes this *fast* for systems programming?
        - should compile down in a similar way to the equivalent procedural code in Rust or C
        - most effect handling does not need to be dynamic
        - most systems cause lots of intermediate allocations or stack switching
- [Combined Effects/Coeffects](https://www.cs.kent.ac.uk/people/staff/dao7/publ/combining-effects-and-coeffects-icfp16.pdf)
    - allow for statically checked compilation configurations
    - explicit variable capture could be modelled as a coeffect
    - could subsume quantitative type theory, implicit arguments, etc
    - not yet integrated into dependent types in the research literature (Granule is working on this)
- Row polymorphism
    - no research on integrating these with dependent records and inductive data types
- Program composition via category theory
    - Challenging to integrate in the presence of strict evaluation
    - Similar problems to effect systems: we don't want to allocate intermediate
      data structures, instead we want to build up stack allocated state machines
      (like in Rust's future and iterator traits) to be executed later

## A possible implementation plan

1. ~~Start with a simple dependent type system, like [LambdaPi](https://www.andres-loeh.de/LambdaPi/)~~
2. Implement additional language extensions needed for actual usefulness
    - ~~dependent records~~
    - ~~let/where bindings~~
    - quantitative type theory
    - implicit arguments
    - instance arguments
    - basic (non-dependent) effect system
    - ~~cumulative universes~~
3. Implement back end(s)
    - JIT and embeddable runtime (for bootstrapping usage) - possibly with
      [HolyJIT](https://github.com/nbp/holyjit) or or [CraneLift](https://github.com/CraneStation/cranelift)
        - CraneLift would unlock WebASM, which would be a huge boost
    - Optimizing compiler - Possibly with LLVM or a verified compiler (like
      CompCert) in the future
        - Figure out how to integrate with libraries written in other languages,
          like C or Rust

By starting with a JIT we could get initial usage from embedding the language
within existing Rust programs, like games. Looking into the future it would also
be nice to then move forward towards implementing a native compiler, however.

At the moment we are building the language in Rust, but perhaps it would be
better to build a verified implementation in Coq/Agda/Lean/Idris/something else.
That way we can actually start proving some of the claims we desire to make
about our system. A concern could be that we go too far down the route of
implementation and it would be extremely challenging to then form a solid
specification for what we are building. On the other hand, as always, the
downside of a verified implementation is that it could take a prohibitive
amount of time to complete.
