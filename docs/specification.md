# Pikelet Language Specification

This will be where we give a comprehensive, formally described specification of the Pikelet programming language, including:

- surface language
  - lexical syntax
  - grammar rules
  - elaboration to the core language
- core language
  - declarative typing rules
  - operational semantics
  - bidirectional type checking
  - serialization format
- environment

We may want to create some form of markup language for this, similar to OTT.
