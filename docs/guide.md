Pikelet is a small [dependently typed][dependent-type-wikipedia] language. It
doesn't do many interesting things yet, but hopefully that will change in the future!

## A small taste

Definitions:

    id : (a : Type) -> a -> a;
    id a x = x;

    const : (a b : Type) -> a -> b -> a;
    const a b x y = x;
in
    record {
        id = id;
        const = const;
    }
```

A pikelet is an odd sort of small (often pre-made) pancake found in Australia

Handily it also has a name that includes 'pi' and 'let' as substrings! ðŸ˜…
