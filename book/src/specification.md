# Language Specification

This part of the documentation is where we describe the syntax and semantics of Pikelet in a more precise way than the [language reference].
It is intended for language developers and programming languages researchers who want to understand the underlying type system of the language.

[language reference]: ./reference.md

## Limitations

It is important to note that we do not claim that these semantics are sound,
but at the very least this specification could form the building blocks of formally verified specification in the future.

## Summary
