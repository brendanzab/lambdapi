Pikelet is a small [dependently typed][dependent-type-wikipedia] language. It
doesn't do many interesting things yet, but hopefully that will change in the future!

> **Note:**
>
> Pikelet is still a work in progress! Many features are not implemented yet!
>
> If you'd like to see what we hope to work on next, have a look at [the roadmap](./development/roadmap).

## A small taste

}
```
