# Records

Records provide a way of grouping together data into [composite data types][composite-data-types-wikipedia].

[composite-data-types-wikipedia]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Composite_data_type

## Types

A record type is a list of entries, consisting of an entry label, and an entry type.
For example, this is a record that defines `width` and `height` extents:

```pikelet
Record {
    width : U32,
    height : U32,
}
```

### Entry dependencies

Entries can be used to constrain the types of later entries.
For example:

```pikelet
Record {
    A : Type,
    a : A,
}
```

Here the type of the entry with the label `a` _depends_ on the type given to
the entry with label `A`.

### Explicit binding names

By default, the binding name of an entry is the same as the label.
In rare cases, however the label name might shadow a binding from a higher scope.
In this case we can give the field a new, internal name using the `as` keyword:

```pikelet
Record {
    -- label
    --  │
    --  │    explicit name binding
    --  │        │
    --  v        v
    String as String-1 : Type,

    -- refers to the built-in `String` type
    --     │
    --     v
    x : String,

    -- refers to the local `String` entry
    --     │
    --     v
    y : String-1,
}
```

### Universes

Record types are also types:

```pikelet
Record {
    first : U32,
} : Type
```

In order to find the universe level of a record type,
we use the universe level the largest entry type:

```pikelet
Record {
    first : U32,
    second : Type^2,
    third : Type,
} : Type^3
```

### Entry order

The order of entries in a record type are significant,
so the following record type is not the same as the one shown above:

```pikelet
Record {
    height : U32,
    width : U32,
}
```

Dependencies must be supplied from the roots to the leaves.
For example the following record would not type check because `A : Type` is not yet defined when `a : A` is declared:

```pikelet
Record {
    a : A,
    A : Type,
}
```

> **Note:**

> The entry order seems annoying!
> It would be nice not to require this in the future, but dependencies make this a challenge!

## Terms

```pikelet
record {}
```

```pikelet
record {
    width = 24,
    height = 33,
} : Record {
    width : U32,
    height : U32,
}
```

### Entry dependencies

The entries of record terms can depend on one another:

```pikelet
record { x = 1, y = x }
    : Record { x : S32, y : S32 }
```

### Entry order

The entries of record terms must be supplied in the order that was specified in the type.
For example this is a type error:

```pikelet
record { y = 2, x = 1 }
    : Record { x : S32, y : S32 }
```

### Explicit binding names

By default, the binding name of an entry is the same as the label.
In rare cases, however the label name might shadow a binding from a higher scope.
In this case we can give the field a new, internal name using the `as` keyword:

```pikelet
record {
    -- label
    --  │
    --  │    explicit name binding
    --  │        │
    --  v        v
    String as String-1 = MyString,

    -- refers to the built-in `String` type
    --           │
    --           │   refers to the local `String` entry
    --           |       |
    --           v       v
    Types = [ String, String-1 ],
} : Record {
    String : Type,
    Types : Array 2 Type,
}
```
