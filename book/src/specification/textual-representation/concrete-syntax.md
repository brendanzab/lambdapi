    | "Fun" ("(" name+ ":" arrow-term ")")+ "->" arrow-term
    | app-term "->" arrow-term

app-term ::=
    | atomic-term
    | atomic-term atomic-term+

atomic-term ::=
    | "(" term ")"
    | name
    | atomic-term "^" number-literal
    | "Record" "{" (type-entry ",")* type-entry? "}"
    | "record" "{" (term-entry ",")* term-entry? "}"
    | atomic-term "." name
    | "[" (term ",")* term? "]"
    | number-literal
    | character-literal
    | string-literal
```
