# Language Guide

Welcome to the Pikelet Language Guide!
This part of the documentation will guide you through the installation of Pikelet,
and show you how to start writing your own programs.

The aim for this guide is to be accessible as possible!
Once you feel comfortable with the basics more detailed descriptions of the Pikelet's features can be found in the [language reference].
