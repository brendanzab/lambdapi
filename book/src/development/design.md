# Design

## Design Principles

- We aim to empower our users through careful design and great documentation,
  rather than being driven by what assume is familiar.
- Pikelet should be able to be progressively disclosed, with surface level features being built out of simpler parts.
- Pikelet should work well for high level and low level, resource constrained applications.
- Pikelet should be easy to bootstrap and cross-compile.
- Pikelet should have excellent compile time error messages and diagnostics.
- Pikelet programs should not have to pay for things that they do not use.
- Language features should behave predictably, as opposed to relying on complicated, hard to understand heuristics.
- Language features should simple to implement, with a high power-to-weight ratio.
- Language features should work in harmony together.

## Research to Watch

There are a number of exciting areas of research that are worth keeping an eye on:

- Dependent types
- High performance elaboration
- Effects and Coeffects
  - Algebraic Effects and Handlers
  - Effect Runners
  - Graded Modal Type Theory
    - Quantitative Type Theory
    - Multistage Programming
- Call by Push Value
- Codata vs. Data
- Modular Programming with Dependent Records
- Fancy Dependencies
  - Self Types
  - Dependent Intersection
  - Very Dependent Types
- Datatype Generic Programming
  - Levitated data descriptions
  - Data Layout Interpretations
  - Ornamented Data Types
- Projectional Editors
