# Pikelet Documentation

:::warning
This section is a work in progress.
:::

This is where we will document the Pikelet programming language!
We'll aim to provide multiple levels of documentation for different purposes:

- [Guide][guide]: For people new to the language
- [Reference][reference]: For people wanting to learn more about individual language features
- [Contributing][contributing]: For people wanting to contribute to the language
- [Specification][specification]: For Pikelet developers and researchers

[guide]: ./guide
[reference]: ./reference
[contributing]: ./contributing
[specification]: ./specification

More sections might be added later, for example tutorials and cookbooks.
