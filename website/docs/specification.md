This will be where we give a comprehensive, formally described specification of the Pikelet programming language, including:

- surface language
  - lexical structure
  - grammar rules
  - elaboration to the core language
- core language
  - declarative typing rules
  - operational semantics
  - bidirectional type checking
  - serialization format
- environment

We may want to create [some form of markup language for this](https://gist.github.com/brendanzab/47fac049f8b40e449db6a9bd60efa57f), similar to OTT.
