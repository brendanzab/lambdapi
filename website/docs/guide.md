Welcome to the _Pikelet Language Guide_.
This book will walk you through some of the features of Pikelet.

The aim for this guide is to be accessible as possible!
Once you feel comfortable with the basics,
the [Pikelet Reference][reference] is there to provide you with more in-depth descriptions of each of the languages's features.

:::warning
Pikelet is still a work in progress! Many features are not implemented yet!

If you'd like to see what we hope to tackle next, have a look at [our roadmap](./contributing/roadmap).

:::note
This guide is still very incomplete!

Topics that this guide might cover are:

- [ ] motivation for Pikelet
- [x] installation of tools
- [ ] first program
- [ ] data structures
- [ ] modular programming using functions records
- [ ] working with universes
- [ ] using Pikelet as a configuration language
- [ ] embedding Pikelet in another program
- [ ] compiling standalone Pikelet programs

We should provide links to the corresponding [reference][reference] material where appropriate.
