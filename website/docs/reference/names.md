### Keywords

Keywords use the same syntax as [identifiers](#identifiers), but are reserved by Pikelet.

The following keywords are reserved by Pikelet:

| Keyword | Purpose |
| ------- | ------- |
| `as` | [Explicit binding names](./records#Explicit-binding-names) |
| `Fun` | [Function formation](./functions#Formation) |
| `fun` | [Function terms](./functions#Terms) |
| `Record` | [Record types](./records#Types) |
| `record` | [Record terms](./records#Terms) |
