Some languages have been inspiring when building Pikelet.
We list some of them here, and the contributions they have made in our thinking.
These ideas may or may not be included in the final Pikelet language, but they are worth mentioning!

## 1ML

Links:

- [Website](https://people.mpi-sws.org/~rossberg/1ml/)

Things we love:

- focus on simplicity
- combines module language of ML with dependent records
- formalized foundation

## Agda

Links:

- [Wiki](http://wiki.portal.chalmers.se/agda/pmwiki.php)

Things we love:

- interactive editing
- dependent types
- dependent records
