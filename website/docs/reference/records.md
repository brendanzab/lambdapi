Records provide a way of grouping together data into [composite data types][composite-data-types-wikipedia].

[composite-data-types-wikipedia]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Composite_data_type

## Types

A record type is a list of entries, consisting of an entry label, and an entry type.
For example, this is a record that defines `width` and `height` extents:

```pikelet
Record {
    width : U32,
    height : U32,
}
```

### Dependency

Entries can be used to constrain the types of later entries.
For example:

```pikelet
Record {
  A : Type,
  a : A,
}
```

Here the type of the entry with the label `a` _depends_ on the type given to
the entry with label `A`.

### Explicit binding names

By default, the binding name of an entry is the same as the label. In rare
cases, however the label name might shadow a binding from a higher scope.
In this case we can give the field a new, internal name using the `as` keyword:

```pikelet
Record {
  -- label
  --  │
  --  │    explicit name binding
  --  │        │
  String as String-1 : Type,

  -- refers to the built-in `String` type
  --     │
  x : String,

  -- refers to the local `String` entry
  --     │
  y : String-1,
}
```

### Universes

Record types are also types:

```pikelet
Record {
  first : U32,
} : Type
```

In order to find the universe level of a record type,
we use the universe level the largest entry type:

```pikelet
Record {
  first : U32,
  second : Type^2,
  third : Type,
} : Type^3
```

### Entry order

The order of entries in a record type are significant,
so the following record type is not the same as the one shown above:

```pikelet
Record {
    height : U32,
    width : U32,
}
```

Dependencies must be supplied from the roots to the leaves.
For example the following record would not type check because `A : Type` is not yet defined when `a : A` is declared:

```pikelet
Record {
  a : A,
  A : Type,
}
```

:::note
The entry order seems annoying!
It would be nice not to require this in the future,
but dependent record types make this a challenge!

```pikelet
record {}
```

```pikelet
record {
    width = 24,
    height = 33,
} : Record {
    width : U32,
    height : U32,
}
```
