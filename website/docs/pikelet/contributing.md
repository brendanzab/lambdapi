## Prerequisites

We use [Rust][rust] as our implementation language, which can be installed using the [rustup] tool.

For the best experience in working with Rust we also recommend installing IDE support for your editor of choice:

- [Rust Analyzer][rust-analyzer] (for VS Code, Vim Emacs, etc.)
- [IntelliJ Rust][intellij-rust] (for IntelliJ-based IDEs)

You can learn more about programming in Rust by reading [The Rust Programming Language][rust-book].

1. Within your fork, create a branch for your contribution. Use a meaningful name.
1. Create your contribution, meeting all [contribution quality standards](#quality-standards).

## Quality Standards

Most quality and style standards are checked automatically by the CI build.
Contributions should:

- Separate each **logical change** into its own commit.
- Include tests for any new functionality in your pull request.
- Document public functions.
- Format code with `cargo fmt`.
- Avoid adding `unsafe` code.
  If it is necessary, provide an explanatory comment on any `unsafe` block explaining its rationale and why it's safe.
- Add a descriptive message for each commit. Follow [these commit message guidelines][commit-messages].
- Document your pull requests. Include the reasoning behind each change, and the testing done.
