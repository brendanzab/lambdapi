# Pikelet Website

This website was created with [Docusaurus](https://docusaurus.io/).

## Prerequisites

To build the book you will first need to install a recent version of [Node](https://nodejs.org).

We recommend using [nvm](https://github.com/creationix/nvm) to manage your Node
installation. It's kind of like rustup for Javascript!

## Running the development server

1. Navigate to this directory
2. Make sure all the dependencies for the website are installed:

```sh
# Install dependencies
$ npm install
```

3. Run your dev server:

```sh
# Start the site
$ npm run start
```

## Deployment to Github Pages

Deployment to Github Pages should happen automatically on the master branch,
during the Travis CI build.
