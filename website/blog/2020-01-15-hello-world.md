Hello everyone, and welcome to the new Pikelet website!

I've been toying around with An implementation of Pikelet for some time now.
Since I started on this journey, I've learned a great deal!

I have rebuilt the Pikelet type checker from the ground up to use [_normalization by evaluation_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Normalisation_by_evaluation).
This is much easier to understand than our previous implementation.

I also posted a gist regarding the future of Pikelet: [Pondering the next version of Pikelet](https://gist.github.com/brendanzab/eba7015e6345abe79a57a704091820bb/).
