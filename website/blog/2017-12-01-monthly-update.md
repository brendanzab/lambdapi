Currently working on trying to implement Areas LÃ¶h et al.'s [tutorial on implementing a dependently typed lambda calculus](https://www.andres-loeh.de/LambdaPi/) in Rust. You can see my progress at [brendanzab/lambdapi](https://github.com/brendanzab/lambdapi). Currently running into an annoying bug with my debruijn indices, so the tests don't currently pass. :(
